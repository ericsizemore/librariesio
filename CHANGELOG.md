The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [Unreleased]

**NOTE:** Version 2.0.0 *should* be backwards compatible (for the most part) with 1.x.
However, if you make use of the `raw`, `toArray`, or `toObject` functions, please check the **CHANGED** section below.

### Added

  * `AbstractClient` class which the main `LibrariesIO` class extends.
  * `Utils` class which holds various useful static methods used throughout the library.
  * New exceptions:
    * Exception\InvalidApiKeyException
    * Exception\InvalidEndpointException
    * Exception\InvalidEndpointOptionsException
  * `vimeo/psalm` as a dev dependency

### Changed

  * The `LibrariesIO` constructor now takes a new option `$clientOptions` which is an array of options to pass to the Guzzle Client.
    * Note, the class will ignore 'base_uri', 'http_errors', 'handler' and 'query' if passed into `$clientOptions`
  * Changed unit tests to pass a `MockHandler` instance to the class (via `$clientOptions`), which is handled in the `AbstractClient` constructor, to ease mocking and testing.
  * The `$client` property is now private.
  * `raw`, `toArray`, `toObject` are no longer part of the main `LibrariesIO` class.
    * They are instead in the `Utils` class and can be accessed statically:
      * `Utils::raw()`, `Utils::toArray()`, `Utils::toObject()`
  * The `LibrariesIO` class now only defines functions to access the API endpoints and leaves the rest of the work up to `AbstractClient` and `Utils`.
  * `Exception\RateLimitExceededException` now takes `GuzzleHttp\Exception\ClientException` as a parameter.
  * Fixes to both code and docblocks/etc. throughout per Psalm.
  * Updated PHP-CS-Fixer configuration and applied fixes per those rules throughout.

### Removed

  * Removed the `$cachePath` property.
  * Removed unnecessary comments throughout.
